    <p>Objectives of Student Information Systems

        The Student Information System is a resource that offers a self-service solution for students to get their administrative tasks done in one place. Equally, it is can support faculty and staff by helping to simplify and integrate work processes.
        
        Since the SIS can be used as a digital dropbox, it's ideal for parents who want to access information on their child, communicate with the school, and even make payments. 
        
        The ability to standardize data formats between divisions means a more unified and clear data readout at a glance, ultimately saving time. Data integrity, privacy, and security can all be protected in an open-access environment.
        
        When it comes to student records, an SIS offers high efficiency as all data is automatically organized and stored for easy access whenever it is needed. 
        
        Since the platform is cloud-based, is can be reconfigured as needed to make sure it grows with an institution. Most SIS offer open interfaces and integration with other campus applications and database systems, making for ease of use. </p>

        <center><h3>How can an Admissions Department use a Student Information System (SIS)</h3></center>
        <p>Admissions is one of the best areas that a Student Information System can create better efficiency. The entire enrollment process can be tracked in one system, from initial inquiry to acceptance and enrollment. For example, an institution can use an auto reply feature to respond to student queries with a selection of standard responses – saving administrative time. 

            This database that is built during the admission process can be used to send admission letters or regret letters to those prospective students. 
            
            For those students inputting information, the system will store all the main and optional subject choices. This is then later used to automatically create subject classes and assignments for teachers.
            
            In most cases, a centralized e-Advising system can send a preregistration notice to students. A web link can provide access to a complete academic planning network that includes information about various programs, courses, fee structures, further progress, and other employment openings. 
            
            Details such as students seeking accommodation in a university scenario are kept separately for assigning rooms.</p>

      <p>It is a common perception that, hostel life has a unique impact on the pattern of students’ life. Living in the hostel makes students socially and behaviorally different.

There is a popular quotation “Times change people change” it is best applicable for the hostel students. Hostel life going to change the way a student is, its effect on the personality behavior, thinking, and dressing as well.
        Hostel is a place where food and lodging are provided for students or certain groups of workers or tourists. Life in a hostel is different from the life in a home. Generally a student stays in a hostel when his residence is located far from his educational institution. Life in a hostel makes a student self-dependent. It makes him smart, active and disciplined. A hostel is controlled by a warden. The warden guides the students. He sees whether the rules of the hostel are being followed or not. To think about the welfare of the students, whether they are being provided tasty meals, good medicare facilities, healthy reading atmosphere as well as neat and clean surroundings. It should be the hard endeavor and top priority of Hostel Warden to make students hostel a centre of excellence, “Where – Peace, Prosperity, brotherhood and communal harmony always prevails. Where Hi-tech education should be the key focus. Where sports and other extra-curricular activities should be the regular feature. Where students with innovative minds and ideas as well as creative talent should always be encouraged. Where there is no scope of hatred, violence and ego clash among students.” Hostel Warden is generally called</p>
