<h2>Student Infomation System</h2><br>
<p>The Student Information System is a resource that offers <a href="https://www.techlearning.com/news/student-information-systems">student </a> self-service solution for students to get their administrative tasks done in one place. Equally, it is can support faculty and staff by helping to simplify and integrate work processes.
Since the SIS can be used as a digital dropbox, it's ideal for parents who want to access information on their child, communicate with the school, and even make payments. 
The ability to standardize data formats between divisions means a more unified and clear data readout at a glance, ultimately saving time. Data integrity, privacy, and security can all be protected in an open-access environment.

 Since the platform is cloud-based, is can be reconfigured as needed to make sure it grows with an institution. Most SIS offer open interfaces and integration with other campus applications and database systems, making for ease of use. </p>
